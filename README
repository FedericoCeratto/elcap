This is elcap version 0.1. A nose plugin that tests mutations of your source code.

This is an early release. All comments are welcome.

Acknowledgments:
This plugin was built using some of the ideas present on Pymutester:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymutester

Usage:
 $ nosetests --with-mutations

Testing:
 $ pip install ludibrio, nose
 $ nosetests tests

Known Limitations:
 - The mutators only work when the mutated node has lineno and col_offset
 - The mutators only work when all nodes are mutated
 - The TestCoverage plugin has some problems with isolation, hence some lines are not reported as covered, affecting the possible mutations 

TODO features:
 - improve reporting of what was mutated (wanted to use codegen, but is really unfinished, already fixed many bugs, but there is still lots to do)
 - timeout: some times after a mutation the tests never finish
 - argument to turn off/on only some mutators

Changelog:
- 16/02/2012: Released version 0.1.5 (added arguments to skip lines or files, improved reporting)
- 08/02/2012: Released version 0.1 (basic functionality)
