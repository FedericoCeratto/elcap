This is elcap version 0.2. A nose plugin that tests mutations of your source
code.

This is an early release. All comments are welcome.

Acknowledgments:
This plugin was built using some of the ideas present on Pymutester:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymutester

Usage:
 $ nosetests --with-mutations

Testing:
 $ pip install ludibrio, nose
 $ nosetests tests

Known Limitations:
 - The mutators only work when the mutated node has lineno and col_offset
 - The TestCoverage plugin has some problems with isolation, hence some lines
   are not reported as covered, affecting the possible mutations.
 - Sometimes the timeout function get stuck and it's not possible to release it.

TODO features:
 - improve reporting of what was mutated (wanted to use codegen, but is really 
   unfinished, already fixed many bugs, but there is still lots to do)
