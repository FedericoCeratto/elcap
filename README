This is elcap version 0.1. A nose plugin that tests mutations of your source code.

This is an early release. All comments are welcome.

Acknowledgments:
This plugin was built using some of the ideas present on Pymutester:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymutester

Usage:
 $ nosetest --with-mutations

Testing:
 $ pip install ludibrio, nose
 $ nosetests tests

Known Limitations:
 - The mutators only work when the mutated node has lineno and col_offset
 - The mutators only work when all nodes are mutated
 - The TestCoverage plugin has some problems with isolation, hence some lines are not reported as covered, affecting the possible mutations 

TODO features:
 - add reporting of what was mutated (wanted to use codegen, but is really unfinished, already fixed many bugs, but htere is still lots to do)
 - timeout: some times after a mutation the tests never finish
 - exlude-mutation argument: regular expression or list of filenames to be exluded from the mutations
 - exclude-line-like argument: exclude lines that match this regular expression to avoid mutation prints, logs or __version__, __author__
 - argument to turn off/on only some mutators
